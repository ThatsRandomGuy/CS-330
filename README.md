How do I approach designing software?

Some new design skills I have picked up from this project include the use of lighting and materials to create a realistic 3D scene. Before this course, I had no idea what goes into making a realistic 3D scene. Now I understand that a combination of textures, lighting, and material types are the fundamentals of creating life-like features on objects. The design process I followed was very basic. I first looked through the requirements for the section I was working on. I then worked step by step to complete small pieces of the project until the whole project was complete. This is the process I use on all big projects because it stops me from being overwhelmed by all the work, and I can still get it done quickly. 

How do I approach developing programs?

Since this is the first time working with OpenGL, there were a lot of new strategies I used. The biggest one is using functions for textures and materials. Instead of entering details about textures and materials for each object, the use of functions allowed me to simplify this work. This is also how iteration factored into my development. Each new material and texture was an iteration of a function that was used to simplify the overall project. Throughout the milestone, I was able to find new and faster ways of performing actions required for a 3D scene. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

OpenGL has opened my eyes to basic computational graphics which has been an interest of mine for a while. It has allowed me to understand how lighting affects textures and materials which I will use in my future graphical endevours. I cannot wait to work with OpenGL and other engines like it in the future.
